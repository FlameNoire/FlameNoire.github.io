                MaxQuest is a time-limited game that runs along a fixed route, takes place in a certain area,  in the real world and in real time.
                The MaxQuest route consists of consecutive checkpoints (certain locations in the real world) that participants need to visit one after another.
                Check-point came up in the guise of the puzzle, which you have to solve by using logic and savvy. If it is not possible to solve it, after a certain time the participants get clues up to the exact place of the checkpoint you need.
                MaxQuest is bound to a specific location and to participate you will need to physically arrive at the launch site, and then visit all the check points.
                Each point is a place in the real world (city or on the road), which has a clear localization (intersection, house number, object).
                To pass a specific checkpoint, the participant needs to physically arrive at the site and communicate through the application. After the successful passage, the participant gets the next point.
                Getting points and fixing their passage is realized through the application for the smartphone.
                The winner is the one who has passed all the points faster than the others.

            <p class="text">
              Excitement is the human emotion that motivates for success. This emotion is a subject of great interest to certain actions and encourages continuing them.
              <br>
              Life without passion is dull and boring. Any success in sports, career or business could be hardly achieved without it.
              <br>
              The dice game has been known in Ancient India and all around the world. Indian collection of the Vedic hymns "The Rigveda" contains the poem "player complaints”. The Bhavishya Purana has a story associated with gambling: a certain Prince has lost everything, including his own wife, because of the playing dice. The epic Mahābhārata refers to the dice as to the gambling game, nevertheless describing it in details.
              <br>
              The first-ever English lottery took place in London in 11 January 1559. Solemn ceremony of the awarding prixes took place not somewhere but in the Church in the Cathedral of St. Paul.
              <br>
              From an economic perspective, lottery is making wagers on money or any material value on the event with shady outcome with the primary intention to make profit or become wealthy. Gambling depends more on luck than on the art of playing, and often the size of the bets is assigned randomly and could be changed during the play. The primary interest is focused not on the game process, but on the outcome of its.
              <br>
              Our quest mainly differs from classic gambling. The decisive factor is not luck, but the participants` skills, aimed to take the quest.
