        <div class="element">
          <p>To give you a quick introduction, we’ve narrowed it down to four of the most common types of video advertising. A good campaign may combine some of each.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
          <p class="title">In-stream video ads</p>
          <p>We’ve all experienced this – it’s the ad that plays before the video you’ve chosen on YouTube, and it’s widely known as pre-roll. (Or mid-roll, or post-role, if it comes halfway through or at the end of your video.) Here, the main benefit is the significant reach it can offer – a potential audience of millions. The downside is that many in-stream ads give the viewer the opportunity to skip the ad after a few seconds, so reach doesn’t necessarily guarantee engagement. How to get around this? Target keywords carefully, and make those first few seconds really, really interesting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
          <p class="title">In-banner video ads</p>
          <p>Here, your video is placed in the standard advertising display areas on relevant websites. They might sit in a standard MPU (Mid-Page Unit) banner, and will play when clicked on, rolled over or automatically when the page loads. Or they might pop up into a small or full screen when the viewer engages with the ad. These ads tend to give more of an interactive experience, as you can support the content with additional features like social media or web links.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
          <p class="title">In-content video ads</p>
          <p>Also known as native ads. This lets you place your video within some relevant editorial content. It’s less disruptive for the viewer as they’re already engaging with the topic, and see your video as an interesting extra. Often, brand will sponsor high-quality, high-ranking websites to enable their content to be included in a post. Do this, and your brand will benefit from the credibility of the website and author. A sponsored story on a trusted site will make your brand feel more trustworthy, too.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="element">
          <p class="title">Social video ads</p>
          <p>Social and gaming apps have become a great platform for ad distribution. As many viewers are using mobile devices, and engaging with and sharing content on the move, video is perfect. It gives you significant reach and, thanks to social media data, lets you advertise to highly targeted groups.</p>

            <p>These commercials can show up only in the zip codes you choose. We can target demographic groups and different “in-market” audiences. For example, if you want to reach ONLY board members of corporations with your commercial, we can get a data list to access those people.</p>

            <p class="title">Frequency Capping</p>
            <p>Pre-roll advertisers can set the precise frequency of viewing so that their audience isn’t annoyed by the message. This also allows for REACH to be extended as impressions aren’t wasted on annoying viewers with too many repeat impressions.</p>

            <p class="title">Complete Transparency</p>
            <p>Pre-roll video advertising allows you to know exactly how many times your video was viewed, by how many people, how many times it was watched to completion, what sites it played on, and what geographic areas it was watched in.</p>

            <p class="title">Clicks to Website</p>
            <p>If you see something interesting on a TV commercial, you can’t click and visit the website. Pre-roll commercials can have interactive overlays that allow the viewer to click and return to your website when they are interested.</p>

          <h2 class="s_title">4 Ways Pre-Roll Video is a Game Changer</h2>
          <p>It is an absolute fact that video is the most powerful communication channel on the internet. As the US public shifts to the internet for their information and entertainment (more each day), they become less reachable by traditional means of advertising. Depending on your target demographic, your entire audience might be impossible to reach without a digital marketing strategy. In traditional advertising TV is both the most expensive and most powerful form of advertising. Pre-Roll video is the internet version of that and it gives the business owner the transparency and targeting of the rest of digital media. We have helped national retailers and local businesses target the zip codes around their shops. This is the power of Pre Roll video.</p>
